# Unit Testing / TDD Workshop Project 
Small C# solution originally created for a unit testing / TDD workshop.

The solution consists of a library with some very basic business logic and a unit test library. Both the business logic and the unit tests are incomplete and should be completed in a TDD manner by reading the test stubs to understand the requirements and implementing the tests and the functionality. The workshop also covers a number of different useful test techniques such as mocking and encourages use of software design techniques to assist in ease of unit testing (or another way to look at it is that the tests encourage good design practices).
